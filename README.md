# Sorting Algorithms Collection

Welcome to the **Sorting Algorithms Collection**, a repository showcasing various sorting techniques implemented in Python. This project is part of my portfolio and demonstrates my understanding of algorithms and clean, efficient code. 

---

## Features

- **Comprehensive Collection**: Includes popular sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, and more.
- **Code Modularity**: Algorithms are available both as individual scripts and in the future in a single consolidated file for convenience.
- **Educational Focus**: Detailed comments and explanations are included in the code to promote understanding.
- **Scalable Design**: Repository structure supports future additions of other algorithm types.

| Quick Sort     | O(n log n)             | O(n²)                   | O(log n)         |
| Merge Sort     | O(n log n)             | O(n log n)              | O(n)             |
| Selection Sort | O(n²)                  | O(n²)                   | O(1)             |
| Insertion Sort | O(n)                   | O(n²)                   | O(1)             |
| Heap Sort      | O(n log n)             | O(n log n)              | O(1)             |
| Shell Sort     | O(n log n)             | O(n²)                   | O(1)             |
| Bucket Sort    | O(n + k)               | O(n²)                   | O(n + k)         |

## How to Use

Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-algorithms.git
```
cd into the new directory
```bash
cd py-sorting-algorithms
```
The integer after the name of the file will determine the length of the test-list used. If no argument is given, it defaults to 15000
```bash
python bubblesort.py 15000
```
